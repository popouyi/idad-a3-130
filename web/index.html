        <p>
          For the last two assignments, I created an audio player that was
          inspired by retro car radios and the ASCII aesthetic. The prototype
          uses Date.now to adapt to the time of day by changing the audio to
          match the different moods of the day. This reflection focuses on the
          design values that guided it, how those values shaped its feedback and
          usability, the major changes through production, and what I learned
          from building it.
        </p>

        <h2>Guiding Design Values and Their Embodiment</h2>
        <p>
          The two core values that influenced the ASCII Car Radio project are
          Clarity and Playfulness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clarity is the main value that I followed when creating this project.
          The minimalistic UI was created for the sake of reducing distractions
          and making each element’s purpose immediately clear. Every single
          feature/element in the ASCII layout has a clear function, without
          being too cluttered and overwhelming. The UI’s structure and
          consistent spacing help users easily understand it, even without
          overcomplicating it. Clarity guided how I grouped information, aligned
          text, and displayed state changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Playfulness was another value that influenced the design. I wanted the
          interface to feel engaging and have character despite its simplicity.
          The scrolling track name, animated equalizer, and time-based “mood”
          settings were all created to add more personality to the project. This
          playfulness was implemented to make the interface feel less robotic
          and dull, and more like a nostalgic experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Feedback, Information Design, Mapping, and Learnability</h2>

        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          The project’s feedback design is heavily inspired by a physical car
          radio, from which I drew inspiration for most of the UI feedback
          elements, adding a modern twist to them. For example, whenever a user
          presses a button, the button lights up to signal that it has been
          clicked, similar to how pressing a physical button produces a tactile
          click. In the project, elements such as the scrolling track name,
          status, volume, mood, and EQ bars all update in real time when they
          receive feedback from users.
        </p>

        <h3>Information Design</h3>
        <p>
          The information design of the website distinguishes different sections
          through the use of dividers and grouping. This approach helps users
          understand the various functions of the project by structuring them in
          a horizontal reading format. Additionally, I chose to position the
          buttons outside the main audio player to mimic physical car radios,
          creating a stronger sense of immersion and nostalgia.
        </p>

        <h3>Mapping and Learnability</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted the prototype’s controls to feel familiar and easy to learn;
          therefore, I implemented well-known keyboard shortcuts such as the
          Spacebar for play/pause and M for mute. To reduce cognitive load for
          users who are less technologically experienced, I labeled each button
          with its corresponding function and included hint text to help guide
          users.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Changes Since the Work-in-Progress Milestone</h2>
        <p>
          I took the feedback that was given to me from the user testing and
          also the assignment 2 submission. Most of the feedback talked about
          the buttons not working, and some of the interactions were a bit
          confusing to interact with.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the buttons, I tried implementing HTML buttons behind the original
          ASCII ones that was suggested from the feedback in the Assignment 2
          submission. But it was a bit too complicated for me to implement
          because i couldn’t figure out how to align them with the original
          buttons. So, I figured just adding HTML buttons outside the media
          player and stylising them so that they fit the aesthetic will also
          work because it also mimics physical retro radios with the buttons
          being located below the track name and volume.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also added the text hints so that users don’t get confused when
          interacting with the webpage. This will help reduce cognitive load and
          make the experience of interacting with the project smoother.

        <h2>Production Timeline & Development Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Phase 1: Planning & Design</strong><br />
          Sketched the ASCII layout with three information zones: track info at
          the top, controls in the middle, EQ visualizer at the bottom. The
          retro aesthetic enforced clarity through constraints.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Phase 2 : Foundation Code</strong><br />
          Built the HTML/CSS/JS structure and implemented Tone.js audio playback
          with play/pause/stop functions, volume control, and a time-based mood
          system that adjusts EQ and playback rate throughout the day.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Phase 3 : The Rendering Struggle</strong><br />
          The main challenge was the scrolling marquee for the track name. The
          track name is 43 characters, but only 30 fit on screen. I struggled
          with creating seamless character-by-character scrolling. First tried
          CSS animations, but they were too smooth and hard to read. Switched to
          JavaScript using modulo arithmetic to create infinite loops, but
          didn't understand how the wrapping mechanism worked or why the index
          needed to reset at the track name length. The solution was creating a
          circular buffer by doubling the string with padding in between, then
          extracting a window of 30 characters that slides through this doubled
          text. This prevented jump-cuts when the scroll loops back to the
          beginning.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Week 4: Audio Selection & EQ Visualizer</strong><br />
          Added the real-time EQ visualizer using Tone.js Analyser, which
          provides waveform data that I mapped to ASCII characters based on
          audio intensity. This was surprisingly straightforward compared to the
          rendering issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Week 5-6: Post Assignment 2</strong><br />
          Received feedback from user testing and assignment 2 feedback.
          Implemented changes such as more responsive buttons, and also a hint
          text to help users navigate the experience better.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Aspect I’m Most Proud Of</h2>
        <p>
          I’m most proud of the ASCII rendering system. The overall look and
          design of the project is similar to what I was going for in the
          initial planning stage. Even in the user testing phase, I was really
          pleased when I saw that the testers enjoyed the look of the experience
          and that it resembled the car radio aesthetic that I was going for.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Most Challenging Aspect</h2>
        <p>
          The hardest challenge was figuring out how to make the ASCII rendering
          system work because of the multiple complex functions, like the
          scrolling track name. But through trials and tribulations, I still
          created something that I’m proud of and I don’t regret putting in all
          of my efforts in this project.
